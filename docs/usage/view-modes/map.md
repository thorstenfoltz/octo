# Map View

For `.geojson` files Octa shows a **slippy map**: OpenStreetMap
tiles in the background, feature geometries painted on top. Pan,
zoom, and switch between tiled and geometry-only rendering.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: map-view-tiles.png: Map view with OSM tiles loaded, several feature geometries painted on top (e.g. a polygon outlining a district, some points marking cities, a line between two points). Default steel-blue palette. -->

## What you're looking at

Two independent layers, stacked:

1. **The basemap** is OSM raster tiles, covering the whole world at
   zoom levels 0-19. Walkers (the egui slippy-map widget) fetches
   the 256×256 PNG tiles for whatever region is visible and stitches
   them into the background.
2. **The GeoJSON layer** is the feature geometries from your file,
   drawn on top via `ui.painter()`. GeoJSON is a **vector overlay**;
   the basemap is independent.

This means you can pan to Japan even if your GeoJSON describes
Germany. The map covers the world; the features are just stamps on
top of it.

## When the Map view appears

The Map view is the **default** for `.geojson` files. The
[Table view](../table-view.md) is still available with one row per
Feature, where properties become columns and the `__geometry`
column holds the feature's geometry as WKT.

## Toolbar

- **Feature count** shows the total number of features in the file.
- **Tiles** / **Geometry only** radio:
  - **Tiles** uses the slippy-map background (default).
  - **Geometry only** paints shapes on a blank canvas. Useful
      offline, or when you want to focus on the data without the map
      distraction.
- **Reset view** drops the current pan/zoom and recentres on the
  feature centroid.

## Interaction

- **Scroll wheel** zooms in / out (plain wheel, no Ctrl needed).
- **Double-click** zooms in.
- **Click-drag** pans.

The default view centres on the **centroid of every feature's
coordinates** so you start looking at the data, not at coordinate
(0, 0) in the middle of the Atlantic.

## Feature rendering

Geometry types and how they paint:

| Geometry type                    | Renders as                         |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Point` / `MultiPoint`           | Filled circle (~5 px radius)       |
| `LineString` / `MultiLineString` | Connected line segments            |
| `Polygon` / `MultiPolygon`       | Filled polygon with outline stroke |
| `GeometryCollection`             | Recurses into members              |
| `Rect` / `Triangle` (rare)       | Treated as polygons                |

The default palette is **steel blue**: a fill at low alpha so
polygon interiors don't hide street labels underneath, plus a
darker outline and point colour for contrast.

!!! note "Polygon holes"

    Polygons with inner rings (holes, the second and subsequent
    coordinate arrays in a `Polygon` definition) are **stroked but
    not cut out of the fill**. egui's painter has no even-odd / winding
    fill rule, so a polygon with a hole renders as a filled outer ring
    with the hole boundary drawn as an outline. The semantic "this is
    a hole" is preserved as a visible boundary, just not as a true
    cut-out.

    This is a deliberate v1 trade-off documented in the source. If
    your dataset depends heavily on cut-out rendering (lakes inside
    countries, etc.), consider visualising in a dedicated GIS tool.

## Configurable tile provider

The default tile URL points at OpenStreetMap:

```
https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
```

Change it under
[**Settings → Map → Tile URL template**](../../reference/settings.md#map).
The template uses `{z}`, `{x}`, `{y}` placeholders for zoom level
and tile coordinates, so any XYZ-compatible server works.

!!! warning "OSM tile-usage policy"

    The default URL is fine for personal / development use. For
    production deployments or sites with non-trivial traffic, please
    honour the [OSM tile-usage
    policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)
    by pointing at a self-hosted or commercial tile provider (Mapbox,
    MapTiler, etc.).

An OSM attribution badge is rendered bottom-right when in Tiles
mode; clicking it opens the OSM copyright page.

## Offline / failed-tile fallback

When the network is down or the tile server is blocked, walkers
shows a grey tile grid where the unfetched tiles would be. The
geometries still paint correctly on top.

If you'd rather see geometry-only by default in that case, set
[**Settings → Map → Fallback to geometry**](../../reference/settings.md#map)
(on by default). Currently this is advisory; walkers' internal
retry mechanism means an outright auto-fallback isn't fully wired
in v1. You can always toggle to **Geometry only** manually from
the toolbar.

## Table view fallback

Switch to **View → Table** to see the features as a flat table:

- The leading `__geometry` column holds the geometry as **WKT**,
  e.g. `POINT(13.405 52.52)`, `POLYGON((-5 -5, 5 -5, 0 5, -5 -5))`.
- Every property key across the feature collection becomes its own
  `Utf8` column (in first-seen order).

This is the lens to use for [SQL queries](../sql.md), where
`SELECT name, __geometry FROM data WHERE population > 1000000`
works as expected.

## Limitations

- **No editing.** Map view is display-only; you can't add / move /
  delete features.
- **No labels yet.** Feature properties don't render as labels on
  the map.
- **No clustering.** A GeoJSON with 100k point features will render
  100k circles.
- **WKB / GeoPackage geometries don't open in the Map view.** Only
  `.geojson` triggers it. GeoPackage opens in the Table view with
  WKB strings.
