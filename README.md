An application for viewing data files. Octa opens files in a spreadsheet-like table view with sorting, filtering, and search. Writing is supported but limited. Octa is primarily a reader.

## Features

### Table View

- Virtual table rendering with smooth scrolling for large datasets
- Lazy row loading for Parquet files (handles millions of rows)
- Inline cell editing with type-aware parsing
- Column resize and drag-and-drop reorder
- Ascending/descending sort by any column
- Cell, row, and column selection with clipboard copy/paste
- Search and filter across all columns in real time

### Multiple View Modes

- **Table View** -- structured spreadsheet display (default)
- **Raw Text View** -- source text with line numbers and optional column alignment
- **Markdown View** -- rendered CommonMark preview
- **Notebook View** -- rendered Jupyter notebook with code cells, markdown cells, and outputs
- **PDF View** -- page-by-page rendered output
- **SQL Query View** -- write a query against the current table (exposed as `data`) and see results beneath; powered by an in-memory DuckDB engine, so any opened file becomes queryable

### Databases (SQLite / DuckDB)

Open a `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db`, `.duckdb`, or `.ddb` file. If the database has multiple user tables, a picker dialog lets you choose one with a column-schema preview. Edits are saved back as **append/update/delete** in a single transaction — Octa never overwrites the file. Schema changes (renaming, adding, or dropping columns) are intentionally rejected on save; do those operations in another tool. Single-table databases auto-load.

### Editing

- Insert, delete, and move rows and columns
- Color marking for cells, rows, and columns with six color choices
- Unsaved-changes guards on close and file open
- Save in the original format or export to a different one via Save As

### Settings

- Configurable font size
- Light and dark theme with the option to set a default

### Other

- CSV delimiter auto-detection (comma, semicolon, pipe, tab) and manual selection
- Auto-update check from GitHub releases
- Cross-platform: Linux and Windows

## Installation

### Linux

Clone the repository and execute the installation script.

```bash
# System-wide (installs to /usr/local)
sudo ./install.sh

# User-local (no sudo needed)
./install.sh ~/.local
```

This compiles the binary, add SVG icon, and desktop entry so Octa appears in your application launcher with file associations for all supported formats.

### Arch Linux

Available on the AUR as `octa` (build from source) and `octa-bin` (prebuilt binary).

```bash
paru -S octa
```

or

```bash
paru -S octa-bin
```

### Windows

Run `install.bat` as Administrator. If it doesn't work, just copy and paste the exe file to the wished location. Please note, Defender will probably prevent
opening, because of an unknown publisher. Expand the warning completely and accept, then it works.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in:

- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/octa/settings.toml` (defaults to `~/.config/octa/settings.toml`)
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Octa\settings.toml`
