## Building

Requires Rust 1.70+ and a C compiler (for native dependencies like mupdf).

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized, stripped)
cargo build --release

# Run directly
cargo run

# Open a file
cargo run -- path/to/file.parquet
```

## Installation

### Linux

```bash
# System-wide (installs to /usr/local)
sudo ./install.sh

# User-local (no sudo needed)
./install.sh ~/.local
```

This installs the binary, SVG icon, and desktop entry so Octo appears in your application launcher with file associations.

### Windows

Run `install.bat` as Administrator. This builds a release binary, copies it to `%ProgramFiles%\Octo`, adds it to your PATH, and creates a Start Menu shortcut.

### Arch Linux

A `PKGBUILD` is available in `.github/aur/` for building an Arch Linux package.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```
