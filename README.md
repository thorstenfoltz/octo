## Why Octa?

One native tool to open, inspect, query, and compare data files across 20+ formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON, Excel, SQLite, DuckDB, GeoPackage, Arrow, Avro, ORC, SAS, SPSS, Stata, RDS, HDF5, NetCDF, DBF, GeoJSON, EPUB, archives, and more)
without spinning up Python, opening a browser, or installing a heavyweight database client. Octa runs as a standalone binary on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The same binary also speaks the Model Context Protocol over stdio (`octa --mcp`), so AI assistants and automation pipelines can read local files directly through Octa instead of round-tripping data through a custom script.

## Features

### Table View

- Virtual table rendering with smooth scrolling for large datasets
- Lazy row loading for Parquet files (handles millions of rows; cap configurable in **Settings → Performance**)
- Inline cell editing with type-aware parsing
- Column resize, drag-and-drop reorder, and double-click best-fit width (**Ctrl+Shift+W** fits every column)
- Ascending/descending sort by any column
- Cell, row, and column selection with clipboard copy/paste
- Search and filter across all columns in real time (Plain / Wildcard / Regex modes)
- Excel-style formulas in cells (`=A1+B1`) and as the "Insert column" formula
- Thousand separators for numeric cells with English (`1,234.56`) / European (`1.234,56`) styles, plus per-column rounding (right-click a column → **Number format…**;
  negative decimals round before the point). Both are display-only and never change saved data

### Multiple View Modes

- **Table** — structured spreadsheet display (default)
- **Raw Text** — source text with line numbers and optional column alignment.
  Syntect-based syntax highlighting kicks in for languages with no dedicated
  view (Python, Rust, shell, Terraform, etc.); the size cap is configurable.
  Shows a dismissible banner when format parsing failed and the file fell back
  to plain text.
- **Markdown** — rendered CommonMark preview with Preview / Split / Edit toggle; Split places a TextEdit next to a live preview.
- **JSON Tree** / **YAML Tree** — collapsible Firefox-style tree for `.json` / `.jsonl` / `.yaml` / `.yml`. Keys are renamable, values are editable, and you can add keys to objects in place.
- **Notebook** — rendered Jupyter notebook with code cells, markdown cells, and outputs. Code cells use syntect highlighting.
- **EPUB Reader** — chapter-by-chapter rendered text for `.epub` files. Top toolbar shows the book title, Previous/Next, and a chapter combo. Embedded images render as a thumbnail strip below the chapter body.
- **Map** — slippy-map view for `.geojson` files. OSM tiles (configurable URL) with feature geometries painted on top. Toolbar toggles Tiles ↔ Geometry-only; plain mouse-wheel zoom; double-click to zoom in.
- **Compare** — side-by-side comparison of two files. Two sub-modes toggle in
  the Compare toolbar: **Text Diff** (git-style line diff) and **Row Hash Diff**
  (BLAKE3-hashed columns; uniques + shared rows bucketed). Cross-format works
  since hashing sees cell text only.
- **SQL Query** — write a query against the current table (exposed as `data`) and see results beneath. Line numbers, chip-style autocomplete, UPPER/lower case conversion.

Press F4 to cycle through the available view modes for the current tab. F8 toggles a session-only **read-only mode** that disables every editing path while still allowing copy and Save-As.

### Editing

- Insert, delete, and move rows and columns
- Colour marking for cells, rows, and columns with six colour choices
- Undo / Redo for cell edits, structural changes, and colour marks
- Leading/trailing whitespace trimmed from string cells and column titles on load (configurable, with a banner listing the affected columns)
- Unsaved-changes guards on close and file open
- Save in the original format or export to a different one via Save As
- **Reopen Last Closed Tab** (default **Ctrl+Shift+T**) restores accidentally-closed tabs
- **Find duplicates** (default **Ctrl+Shift+D**) picks dedupe-key columns and either highlights duplicate rows or opens them in a new tab

### Inspecting data

- **Column Inspector** (default **Ctrl+I**) — schema-level overview of every column with types, null counts, and basic stats
- **Value Frequency** (default **Ctrl+Shift+I**, or **Analyse → Value frequency…** with a column picker) — `value_counts()`-style top-N values for any column.
  Numeric columns can be turned into a histogram: type a bin count (or leave it for automatic Sturges binning) and get that many equal-width ranges with their counts
- **Schema Export** (default **F7**) — render the column list as Postgres / MySQL / SQLite / Databricks / Snowflake DDL, Pydantic v2, TypeScript interface, JSON Schema, or a Rust struct. Also available from the CLI (`octa --export-schema`) and over MCP.
- **Chart** (default **F5** / **Analyse → Chart**) — open a new tab plotting the active table as a histogram, bar, line, scatter, or box chart via `egui_plot`.
  Customisable title / axis / legend / per-series colour, PNG/SVG/PDF export, log scale. See [Chart](docs/usage/chart.md).

### Archives

`.zip`, `.tar`, and `.tgz` files open as a read-only table listing
each entry's `path`, `size_bytes`, `compressed_bytes`, `mtime`,
`is_dir`, and `type`. An action bar above the table extracts the
selected entry into a tempfile and opens it as a new tab through
the normal file-open path — so any reader Octa supports (CSV,
JSON, Parquet, …) works on entries inside an archive. `.tar.gz` is
not auto-routed; rename to `.tgz` or use **File → Open → All
files**.

### Command-line

Octa is also a CLI. With no flags it launches the GUI; with one of the action flags it runs that action and exits:

```bash
octa --schema data.parquet                  # print column schema
octa --head data.csv -n 5                    # first N rows (default 20)
octa --head data.csv -n 5 -f json            # output as JSON instead of TSV
octa --convert in.csv out.parquet            # convert formats
octa --sql data.parquet -q 'SELECT count(*) FROM data'
octa --export-schema data.parquet -t snowflake   # schema as DDL / model / struct
```

Output format is selectable with `-f / --format {tsv|json|csv}` (TSV default). Run `octa --help` for the full reference.

### MCP server

`octa --mcp` starts a Model Context Protocol server on stdio. Eleven tools cover
the CLI surface plus inspection helpers: `read_table`, `schema`, `list_tables`,
`count_rows`, `run_sql`, `convert`, `export_schema`, `profile`,
`find_duplicates`, `value_frequency`, `search`. Defaults (row limit + per-cell
byte cap) are configurable under **Settings → MCP**. Add it to any MCP client
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, MCP Inspector) and the model can answer questions
about your local data files.

### Settings

- Configurable font size and theme (light / dark, default switchable)
- JetBrains Mono / system mono / match-UI font picker for the SQL editor
- Per-format performance knobs: streaming row cap, syntax-highlight size cap
- User-extensible "open as plain text" extension list
- Remappable keyboard shortcuts

### Other

- CSV delimiter auto-detection (comma, semicolon, pipe, tab) and manual selection
- Date inference for text-formatted columns (CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.) with an ambiguity picker for European vs US-format dates
- Auto-update check from GitHub releases
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, and Windows

## CLI & MCP Server

### CLI Usage

Octa ships a small CLI alongside the GUI. With no flags it launches the GUI; pass one of the action flags to run that action and exit:

```bash
octa --schema data.parquet      # print column schema
octa --head data.csv -n 5       # preview the first rows
octa --describe data.csv        # format + size + schema + sample in one call
octa --help                     # full reference with worked examples
```

Action flags are mutually exclusive. The full set is documented in [`docs/cli/`](https://thorstenfoltz.github.io/octa/cli/) and via `octa --help`. Output format for table-printing actions is selectable with `-f / --format {tsv|json|csv}` (TSV default).

These flags work identically across every distribution channel: a plain binary off the releases page, an `install.sh` install, the AUR package, or an AppImage.

```bash
./Octa-x86_64.AppImage --schema myfile.parquet
```

### MCP Server

`octa --mcp` starts a stdio-based [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that exposes Octa's file-reading capabilities as MCP tools.
AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, MCP Inspector, any MCP-compatible client) and automation pipelines can then read local Parquet, CSV, DuckDB, SQLite, Excel,
and every other supported format directly, without scripting a Python or JS shim in between.

The startup banner reports the resolved defaults:

```text
$ octa --mcp
octa --mcp ready (default response row limit: 1000, cell cap: 65536 bytes, file-loader cap: 5000000; override per-call via `limit` / `unlimited`)
```

What those defaults mean:

- **Row limit (1000)** caps how many rows the *response* carries, so an AI client doesn't flood its context with millions of rows by accident.
- **Cell cap (65,536 bytes)** guards against a single oversized BLOB or long-text cell dominating the response. Oversized cells get a `[truncated: ...]` marker pointing the model at `run_sql` to slice the value.
- **File-loader cap (5,000,000 rows)** is the streaming-format safety net for very large files (Parquet, CSV, TSV).

Every limit is overridable per call: pass `limit: 0` for an unlimited response, and `unlimited: true` on any read-bearing tool to lift the file-loader cap for that single call.
Defaults themselves live under **Settings → MCP** and **Settings → Performance**.

`octa --mcp` works with every distribution format: plain binary, `install.sh`, AUR package, and AppImage. No wrapper script and no separate install step are needed; the same binary that opens the GUI is the MCP endpoint.

#### Claude Desktop config example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octa": {
      "command": "/path/to/octa",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

`/path/to/octa` can be a system-installed binary (`/usr/local/bin/octa`), a user-local install (`~/.local/bin/octa`), or an AppImage path (`/home/you/Octa-x86_64.AppImage`).
See [`docs/mcp/setup.md`](https://thorstenfoltz.github.io/octa/mcp/setup/) for Claude Code, MCP Inspector, and other clients.

## Installation

### Linux

The simplest option is to **download a pre-built binary** from the
[releases page](https://github.com/thorstenfoltz/octa/releases) and run it
directly — no installation step is required:

```bash
chmod +x octa
./octa                  # run from anywhere
# or place it on your PATH, e.g. ~/.local/bin/octa
```

An [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) is also published alongside each
release for users who prefer a single self-contained file:
`chmod +x Octa-*-x86_64.AppImage && ./Octa-*-x86_64.AppImage`. See
[Installation → AppImage](docs/getting-started/installation.md#appimage)
for the FUSE-less fallback.

Use `install.sh` only if you want Octa to appear in your application
launcher with an icon and file associations, or if you want to build from
source. The script detects whether a pre-built `octa` binary is next to it
and uses it; otherwise it builds from source, which requires the Rust
toolchain (install from <https://rustup.rs/>).

```bash
# System-wide (installs to /usr/local)
sudo ./install.sh

# User-local (no sudo needed)
./install.sh ~/.local
```

`install.sh` also installs a man page to
`$PREFIX/share/man/man1/octa.1`, so **`man octa`** works once the
install finishes. Release tarballs ship a pre-rendered `octa.1`;
source installs render it from `docs/cli/octa.1.adoc` on the fly if
`asciidoctor` is on `PATH`.

Building from source additionally requires a C compiler and the native
libraries listed in `CLAUDE.md` (GTK, fontconfig, freetype, etc.).
`asciidoctor` is optional but recommended (so the man page gets
installed).

### Arch Linux

Available on the AUR as `octa` (build from source) and `octa-bin` (prebuilt binary).
Both install `man octa` automatically.

```bash
paru -S octa
```

or

```bash
paru -S octa-bin
```

### Windows

The simplest option is to **download `octa.exe`** from the
[releases page](https://github.com/thorstenfoltz/octa/releases) and run it
directly — no installation needed. Place it wherever you like (e.g. your
Desktop or `C:\Tools\`) and double-click to launch.

Optionally, `install.bat` copies the binary into `Program Files\Octa`,
generates an `.ico` (if ImageMagick is on PATH), and creates a Start Menu
shortcut. Right-click and choose **Run as administrator**. It does *not*
modify your `PATH`; open Octa via the Start Menu shortcut or by running
`"C:\Program Files\Octa\octa.exe"` directly.

**Windows SmartScreen warning:** Octa is not code-signed, so on first
launch Windows shows *"Windows protected your PC"*. Click **More info**,
then **Run anyway**. Subsequent launches open without the prompt.

### macOS

The simplest option is to **download the macOS `.app` bundle** from the
[releases page](https://github.com/thorstenfoltz/octa/releases). The
release artifact targets Apple Silicon. Drop `Octa.app` into
`/Applications` (or anywhere else) and double-click to launch.

**First-launch unsigned-app warning:** Octa is not code-signed or
notarized, so macOS quarantines the app the first time you launch it.
You'll see *"Octa.app cannot be opened because the developer cannot be
verified"*. Two ways around it:

- Right-click the app icon in Finder, choose **Open**, then click **Open**
  in the confirmation dialog. macOS remembers the choice for that copy
  of the app.
- Or remove the quarantine attribute from a terminal:

```bash
# Locate the bundle and confirm its quarantine attribute is present
find /Applications -maxdepth 1 -name "Octa.app" -exec xattr {} \;

# Strip the attribute (top-level only — macOS only quarantines the bundle)
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Octa.app

# If the strip above fails with "No such xattr: …" but the warning persists,
# fall back to the recursive form once (handles "Octa.app is damaged"):
# xattr -cr /Applications/Octa.app
```

To build from source, install the Rust toolchain (<https://rustup.rs/>)
and the native dependencies via Homebrew, then `cargo build --release`:

```bash
brew install harfbuzz freetype gtk+3
cargo build --release
```

The resulting binary lives at `target/release/octa`.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in:

- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/octa/settings.toml` (defaults to `~/.config/octa/settings.toml`)
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Octa/settings.toml`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Octa\settings.toml`

## Alternatives

A factual feature comparison against tools in the adjacent space. "Yes" means the feature is available out of the box in the default free distribution; the columns are not a quality judgement and the list is not exhaustive.
