## Installation

### Arch Linux

Available on the AUR as `octa` (build from source) and `octa-bin` (prebuilt binary).

```bash
paru -S octa
```

or 

```bash
paru -S octa-bin
``` 

### Other Linux Distros

Clone the repository and execute the installation script.

```bash
# System-wide (installs to /usr/local)
sudo ./install.sh

# User-local (no sudo needed)
./install.sh ~/.local
```

This installs the binary, SVG icon, and desktop entry so Octa appears in your application launcher with file associations for all supported formats.

### Windows

Run `install.bat` as Administrator. If it doesn't work, just copy and paste the exe file to the wished location. Please note, Defender will probably prevent
opening, because of an unknown publisher. Expand the warning completely and accept, then it works.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in:

- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/octa/settings.toml` (defaults to `~/.config/octa/settings.toml`)
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Octa\settings.toml`
